# cs231n-final_project
Stanford CS231N Final Project - ASL Gesture Recognition

### Details
- This repo contains code for running various ML models on American Sign Language videos.
- The project was focused on experimenting with various activity recognition techniques for recognition of bodily movements where the body is the immediate subject.
- Our approaches covered 3DConvNets, individual frame classification with transfer learning, and RNNs for classifying videos
- Due to a limited dataset, we had trouble developing a model that generalized well for this task
- See the file `CS231N_Project_Report.pdf` for additional information about the project and outcomes.

### Structure
- Scripts in the data folder pertain to sourcing the American Sign Language Video Lexicon Dataset
- Files in the top level contain classes and model descriptions for the different models developed and tested in this project
